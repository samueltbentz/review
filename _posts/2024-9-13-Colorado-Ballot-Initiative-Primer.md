subtitle: Rundown of Six Initiatives on the Ballot this Fall
---

There are 14 statewide initiatives on the ballot in Colorado this Fall. They cover a wide variety of issues related to abortion, school choice, and law enforcement. Below is a short guide for six of the key ballot initiatives which Christians should rally to support or oppose this Fall. The initiatives include potential amendments to the State Constitution put forward by both citizens and legislators.

For reference, the Colorado Democrat Party released their [Democrat voter guide](https://www.coloradodems.org/ballotmeasures) suggesting which initiatives to vote for, vote against and initiatives where they hold "No Position." The Colorado GOP similarly released their suggested [voting guide](https://www.cologop.org/2024-colorado-ballot-questions/) which features 13 of the 14 ballot initiatives with short explanations of their positions.

## Amendment 79 ##

**Creates a right to abortion in the state constitution as well as allowing use of public funds for abortion services.**

Democrats in Colorado have already made abortion at any point in the pregnancy legal. This initiative is the final step to solidify their celebration of abortion, making it a constitutional right in our state. Not only would this establish abortion as a constitutionally expressed right but it would also allow public funds to be used for abortion services. Unsurprisingly, this is at the top of the list on the Democrat Party website and in regards to the ballot initiatives this Fall, it is their priority #1. There is no Christian argument in favor of this Amendment to secure the right to murder children. It must be opposed and opposed strongly.

## Amendment J ##

**Removes the provision in the state constitution that indicates "Only a union of one man and one woman shall be valid or recognized as a marriage in this state."**

This amendment, if passed, would remove language from the state's constitution that indicates marriage is only between a man and a woman. Similar to Amendment 79 above, this is a simple decision for Christians. God has clearly designed marriage to exist only between a man and a woman, as our state constitution currently recognizes. Christians have a responsibility to uphold truth and reality and therefore should oppose this amendment. While Obergefell is still recognized, nothing would change in the short-term in Colorado. However, if the Supreme Court were to overturn Obergefell, it would give Coloradans an opportunity to effectively preserve natural marriage by falling back to the state constitution, similar to what we have seen play out following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. It is worth mentioning that the Colorado Democrat voter guide supports this amendment and the Colorado GOP voting guide fails to even mention this amendment on their site. It is likely that the GOP is trying to avoid publicizing a position on this amendment in fear of retribution from moderate Republicans and Christians alike.

## Amendment 80 ##

**Provides a constitutional right to school choice which includes charter, private, homeschool, open enrollment options and local neighborhood schools.**

This measure was organized by [Advance Colorado](https://www.advancecolorado.org/)  and establishes school choice for children and parents, which already exists in Colorado, a constitutional right. The Colorado Democrat Party opposes this amendment and has recently taken aim at charter schools in our state as parents look for options outside of the public school system. The Republican party holds no position on this amendment because there are concerns over the language which some believe usurps parental authority. Opting out of government schools and instead giving your children a Christian education is one of the most important and necessary ways for Christians to meaningfully engage in our nation and state today. Christians should vote Yes on Amendment 80 to secure the right of parents to direct the education of their children. Given the current environment, Christians should also hope and pray for the government school system to lose attendance and influence in our state. This amendment, while insufficient, is a step in the right direction and a helpful protective measure.

## Proposition 128 ##

**Updated parole eligibility requirements which would require offenders of certain violent crimes to serve at least 85% of their sentence before parole eligibility and offenders with two or more prior violent crime convictions to serve their full sentence before beginning parole.**

This initiative increases required prison time for violent criminals before they are eligible for parole. Organized by Advance Colorado, it would help protect our state by keeping violent criminals locked up for longer. Our society, in the name of justice, has softened on penalties for crime. Most notably, capital punishment was abolished in Colorado in 2020. We need a higher level of enforcement on crime and we need more people in prison, not less. Christians should recognize the duty of government to execute justice and punish evildoers and vote in support of this proposition.

## Proposition 130 ##

**Funds law enforcement including a new $1-million death benefit for first responders killed in duty.**

Colorado is an hostile place to work as a police officer due to the government's decision to ban qualified immunity. This initiative, organized by Advance Colorado, supports law enforcement, particularly those who sacrifice their life for the safety of our state. Notably, the Democrats in Colorado took a 'No Position' on the issue. In the face of rampant illegal immigration and homelessness, Christians should support law enforcement by voting Yes on Proposition 130. Again, our state needs more enforcement of the law, not less.

## Proposition KK ##

**Introduce a 6.5% excise tax on all firearm and ammunition manufacting and sales.**

This initiative would introduce an additional tax on firearm and ammunition manufacturing, purchases and sales. Put forward by the legislature, this continues the assault on the Second Amendment's right to bear arms made by the Left in our state. Since they are unable to fully ban guns in Colorado, they are attempting to hassle gun owners and manufacturers in any way they can. Christians have long recognized the necessity of self-defense and therefore should oppose Proposition KK this Fall.
