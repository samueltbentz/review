The mission of Centennial Frontier is to promote a distinctly Christian approach to the political and cultural realities in Colorado. CF aims to equip Christians to live faithfully in Colorado as well as to serve as ambassadors of reality to all of Colorado. In the face of statewide decline, order can only be preserved and sustained by a turning to Christ and His teachings. The answer is not to become more like our enemies but to instead strengthen our own distinctivness and most notably, welcome and acknowledge the Christian foundation to all that we believe.
