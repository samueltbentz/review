The mission of Rocky Mountain Frontier is to promote a distinctly Christian approach to the political and cultural realities in Colorado. RMF aims to equip Christians to live faithfully in Colorado as well as to serve as ambassadors of reality to all of Colorado. In the face of cultural decline in our state, order can only be sustained by a living Christian faith.
